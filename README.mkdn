# NAME

Map::Tube::Frankfurt - Map::Tube::Frankfurt - interface to the Frankfurt S- and U-Bahn map

# VERSION

# DESCRIPTION

It currently provides functionality to find the shortest route between
the two given stations. The map contains both U-Bahn and S-Bahn stations.

# CONSTRUCTOR

Station names are case insensitive. The station sequence from _START_
to _END_ is returned.

## Development

The distribution is contained in a Git repository, so simply clone the
repository

```
$ git clone http://github.com/reneeb/Map-Tube-Frankfurt.git
```

and change into the newly-created directory.

```
$ cd Map-Tube-Frankfurt
```

The project uses [`Dist::Zilla`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla) to
build the distribution, hence this will need to be installed before
continuing:

```
$ cpanm Dist::Zilla
```

To install the required prequisite packages, run the following set of
commands:

```
$ dzil authordeps --missing | cpanm
$ dzil listdeps --author --missing | cpanm
```

The distribution can be tested like so:

```
$ dzil test
```

To run the full set of tests (including author and release-process tests),
add the `--author` and `--release` options:

```
$ dzil test --author --release
```
